### CLI file renamer

Simple CLI-app for renaming all files in a folder with an incrementing number.

### Usage:

- Put the files you want to rename into the input folder.

- Run this through the terminal by typing "node ." while you are in this programs main directory.
- Enter name you want to give all the files.

- You can also use the -i and -n arguments to set a different folder to look in and the name you want to give the files, directly upon running the program; thus skipping the prompts and starting rename immediately if typed correctly. ./input is the default input folder.
- ex: node . -i ./otherFolder -n foo
